### Perceptron
The perceptron classification algorithm is a more basic procedure, based on dot products between examples and weights. 
Whenever an example is misclassified the sign of the dot product is at odds with the classification value (âˆ’1 and 1) in the training set.
To correct this, the example vector will be iteratively added or subtracted from thevector of weights or coefficients, progressively updating its elements:
