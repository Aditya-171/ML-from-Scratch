### Arbitrary Value Imputation
---

Arbitrary value imputation consists of replacing all occurrences of missing values (NA) within a variable by an arbitrary value.
When replacing missing values with an arbitrary number, we need to be careful not to select a value close to the mean or the median, or any other common value of the distribution.
Arbitrary number imputation can be used when data is not missing at random, when we are building non-linear models, and when the percentage of missing data is high. This imputation technique distorts the original variable distribution.
