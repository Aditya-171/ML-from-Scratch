## K-Nearest Neigbours

---

K-Nearest Neighbours is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. 
It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection

In order to determine which data points are closest to a given query point, the distance between the query point and the other data points will need to be calculated. These distance metrics help to form decision boundaries, which partitions query points into different regions.
You commonly will see decision boundaries visualized with Voronoi diagrams.

1. Euclidean distance
2. Manhattan distance
3. Minkowski distance
4. Hamming distance
